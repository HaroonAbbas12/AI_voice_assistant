This repository contains two Python-based AI voice assistant programs. The first is a general AI voice assistant, and the second is a wake word AI assistant, both utilizing the ChatGPT API for natural language processing. These assistants can take voice input, process it through the ChatGPT API, and provide audio responses.

Features:
AI Voice Assistant: A general assistant that takes voice commands, processes them using ChatGPT, and responds with relevant information or actions.
Wake Word Assistant: An AI assistant that listens for a specific wake word and, upon detecting it, activates to take user commands and provide answers using the ChatGPT API.
Speech Recognition: Converts spoken language to text.
Text-to-Speech: Converts text responses from the AI to audible speech.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
ChatGPT API key 
External libraries:
openai for API integration
speech_recognition for converting voice to text
pyttsx3 for text-to-speech conversion
